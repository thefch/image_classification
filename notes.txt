SVM notes:
	SVM works by mapping data to a high-dimensional feature space so that data points
	can be categorized. They are categorized with two categories (either 1 or -1).
	** SVM returns different accuracy each time the program runs. 
		Possible issue: There is an issue when loading the data from the .mat file
						that impacts the SVM classification.
